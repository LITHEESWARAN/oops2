    "1. Concept of Encapsulation in Python and its Role in Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. In Python, encapsulation is used to restrict direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of encapsulation in OOP is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Protect the integrity of the data: By restricting access to the data, it prevents external code from making unintended or harmful changes.\n",
    "Enhance maintainability: Encapsulation allows changes to be made to the implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
    "Promote modularity and code reusability: By encapsulating data and behavior within a class, it becomes easier to reuse code in different parts of a program or in different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key Principles of Encapsulation: Access Control and Data Hiding\n",
    "Access Control: This refers to the mechanism by which access to certain parts of a class is controlled. In Python, this is typically managed through access modifiers like public, protected, and private.\n",
    "Data Hiding: This principle involves restricting access to certain attributes or methods within a class to prevent external interference and misuse. Data hiding is achieved by marking attributes or methods as private or protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Achieving Encapsulation in Python Classes\n",
    "Encapsulation in Python can be achieved by using private and protected access modifiers to restrict access to certain attributes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Accessing the private attribute via a getter\n",
    "person.set_name(\"Bob\")    # Modifying the private attribute via a setter\n",
    "print(person.get_name())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Difference Between Public, Private, and Protected Access Modifiers\n",
    "Public (self.name): Accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.\n",
    "Protected (self._name): Intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses. It can still be accessed from outside the class, but it's understood that it should not be.\n",
    "Private (self.__name): Strongly restricts access, making the attribute or method inaccessible from outside the class. Python uses name mangling to enforce this, making it harder (but not impossible) to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Person Class with a Private Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Alice\n",
    "person.set_name(\"Bob\")\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Bob\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Purpose of Getter and Setter Methods in Encapsulation\n",
    "Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to private attributes. They allow for validation or modification of the attribute before accessing or changing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

    "            \n",
    "7. Name Mangling in Python\n",
    "Name mangling in Python is a technique used to make the private attributes and methods of a class more difficult to access from outside the class. Python prepends a single underscore and the class name to the name of private attributes and methods to achieve this.\n",

    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
