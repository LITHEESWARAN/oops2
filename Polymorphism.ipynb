    "1. What is Polymorphism in Python?\n",
    "Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in a way that's specific to their type. In the context of object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism allows methods to be defined in a base class and overridden by derived classes, enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compile-time vs. Runtime Polymorphism in Python\n",
    "Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading): This occurs when multiple methods with the same name but different parameters exist in the same scope. Python does not support method overloading directly, as it allows the most recent definition of a method to overwrite previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding): This occurs when a method in a derived class overrides a method in its base class. The method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object's type.\n",

    "4. Concept of Method Overriding in Polymorphism\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is a key feature of runtime polymorphism, allowing a subclass to define behavior that is specific to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "Polymorphism: Allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface (e.g., method overriding).\n",

    "7. Abstract Methods and Classes in Achieving Polymorphism\n",
    "Abstract classes in Python are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are meant to be subclassed. An abstract class can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a common interface across different subclasses.\n",

    "9. Significance of isinstance() and issubclass() in Polymorphism\n",
    "isinstance(object, class): Checks if an object is an instance of a class or a subclass thereof.\n",
    "issubclass(subclass, superclass): Checks if a class is a subclass of another class.\n",
    "These functions are useful in polymorphic designs to ensure that objects are treated according to their type or hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Role of @abstractmethod Decorator in Achieving Polymorphism\n",
    "The @abstractmethod decorator is used to declare a method as abstract in an abstract class. It enforces that the method must be implemented in any subclass.\n",

    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

    "12. Benefits of Polymorphism: Code Reusability and Flexibility\n",
    "Polymorphism allows for a high level of code reusability by letting the same method be used on different types of objects. It also increases flexibility by enabling the design of systems that can handle new classes of objects without modifying the existing codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Use of super() in Python Polymorphism\n",
    "The super() function allows a derived class to call methods of its base class. This is particularly useful in method overriding scenarios, where the derived class wants to extend or modify the behavior of the base class's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Animal:\n",

    "15. Operator Overloading and Its Relation to Polymorphism\n",
    "Operator overloading allows the same operator to have different meanings based on the context or types of operands. This is a form of polymorphism where operators are treated as methods that can be overridden.\n",
