    "1. Concept of Composition in Python\n",
    "Composition in Python is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. Instead of inheriting behavior, a class achieves functionality by including instances of other classes as attributes. This allows the construction of complex objects from simpler ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Composition vs. Inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Composition: Describes a \"has-a\" relationship where one class contains an instance of another class. It is more flexible as it allows changing or replacing components without altering the class hierarchy.\n",
    "Inheritance: Describes an \"is-a\" relationship where a class derives from another class, inheriting its attributes and methods. It can lead to tight coupling and less flexibility in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Author and Book Classes with Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "class Author:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, birthdate):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.birthdate = birthdate\n",
    "\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, author):\n",
    "        self.title = title\n",
    "        self.author = author  # Composition: Book \"has-an\" Author\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_book_info(self):\n",

    "book = Book(\"1984\", author)\n",
    "print(book.get_book_info())  # '1984' by George Orwell, born on 25 June 1903\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Benefits of Composition Over Inheritance\n",
    "Flexibility: Composition allows objects to be composed of various components, making it easier to swap out or modify parts without affecting the overall design.\n",
    "Reusability: Components can be reused across different classes without being tied to a specific inheritance chain.\n",
    "Loose Coupling: Composition leads to loosely coupled systems, where changes in one component have minimal impact on others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Implementing Composition in Python Classes\n",
    "Composition is implemented by creating instances of other classes as attributes within a class.\n",

    "7. \"Has-a\" Relationships in Composition\n",
    "In composition, a \"has-a\" relationship indicates that one class contains an instance of another class. For example, a Car has an Engine, which means the Car class will have an instance of the Engine class as an attribute.\n",

    "9. Concept of Delegation in Composition\n",
    "Delegation refers to the practice of an object handling a request by delegating the task to a composed object. This simplifies complex systems by breaking down responsibilities into smaller, manageable components.\n",

    "11. Encapsulating and Hiding Composed Objects\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation can be achieved by making attributes private (prefixing with __). This hides the internal composition details from external access, maintaining abstraction.\n",
