    "1. What is Abstraction in Python?\n",
    "Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. In the context of object-oriented programming (OOP), abstraction allows the user to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand the complexities of how they work internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Benefits of Abstraction\n",
    "Code Organization: Abstraction helps in organizing code by breaking down complex systems into simpler, more manageable parts.\n",
    "Complexity Reduction: By hiding unnecessary details, abstraction reduces complexity, making the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",

    "4. Abstract Classes in Python Using abc Module\n",
    "Abstract classes in Python are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are designed to be subclassed. They can contain abstract methods, which must be implemented by any subclass. The abc module in Python provides the tools needed to create abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

    "5. Differences Between Abstract and Regular Classes\n",
    "Abstract Classes: Cannot be instantiated directly. They are used to define a blueprint for other classes.\n",

    "7. Interface Classes in Python and Their Role in Abstraction\n",
    "While Python doesn't have a dedicated interface keyword like some other languages, abstract classes can be used to achieve a similar effect. An interface class typically contains only abstract methods, and it defines a contract that implementing classes must fulfill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

    "9. Significance of Encapsulation in Achieving Abstraction\n",
    "Encapsulation is a key concept in OOP that helps achieve abstraction by hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interactions to be performed through methods. This not only protects the object's integrity but also hides the implementation details, providing a clean and simple interface for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__fuel_level = 0  # Private attribute\n",

    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "10. Purpose of Abstract Methods in Enforcing Abstraction\n",
    "Abstract methods in Python enforce abstraction by requiring that any subclass implement these methods. This ensures that all subclasses provide specific implementations of the abstract methods, adhering to the intended interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Stack (ADT): A stack is an ADT with operations like push, pop, and peek. The actual implementation of how the stack is stored (e.g., using a list or a linked list) is abstracted away.\n",
