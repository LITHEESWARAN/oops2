    "# Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is inheritance in Python? Explain its significance in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "Inheritance in Python is a mechanism where a new class inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class. It is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It allows code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes, which is significant in object-oriented programming as it promotes modularity and organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Differentiate between single inheritance and multiple inheritance in Python. Provide examples for each.\n",
    "Single inheritance occurs when a class (child class) inherits from a single parent class. Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Inheritance Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Inheritance Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent1:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        Parent1.__init__(self, name)\n",
    "        Parent2.__init__(self, age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Create a Python class called `Vehicle` with attributes `color` and `speed`. Then, create a child class called `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds a `brand` attribute. Provide an example of creating a `Car` object.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, speed):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.speed = speed\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, speed, brand):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color, speed)\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "car = Car(\"Red\", 150, \"Toyota\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explain the concept of method overriding in inheritance. Provide a practical example.\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The subclass method overrides the parent class method.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. How can you access the methods and attributes of a parent class from a child class in Python? Give an example.\n",
    "You can access methods and attributes of a parent class using the `super()` function or by directly referencing the parent class.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "print(child.name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Discuss the use of the `super()` function in Python inheritance. When and why is it used? Provide an example.\n",
    "The `super()` function is used to call methods from the parent class. It is commonly used in the `__init__()` method to ensure that the parent class is properly initialized.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Create a Python class called `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Then, create child classes `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Animal` and override the `speak()` method. Provide an example of using these classes.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "dog.speak()\n",
    "cat.speak()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Explain the role of the `isinstance()` function in Python and how it relates to inheritance.\n",
    "The `isinstance()` function checks if an object is an instance or subclass of a class or tuple of classes. It is used to verify the type of an object in relation to inheritance.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "print(isinstance(dog, Animal))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. What is the purpose of the `issubclass()` function in Python? Provide an example.\n",
    "The `issubclass()` function checks if a class is a subclass of another class. It returns `True` if the first class is a subclass of the second.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "print(issubclass(Dog, Animal))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Discuss the concept of constructor inheritance in Python. How are constructors inherited in child classes?\n",
    "Constructors in Python are not inherited automatically. However, a child class can call the parent class constructor using `super()`. This allows the child class to initialize attributes from the parent class.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Create a Python class called `Shape` with a method `area()` that calculates the area of a shape. Then, create child classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape` and implement the `area()` method accordingly. Provide an example.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)\n",
    "print(circle.area())\n",
    "print(rectangle.area())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Explain the use of abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python and how they relate to inheritance. Provide an example using the `abc` module.\n",
    "Abstract base classes (ABCs) are used to define common interfaces for a group of related classes. They canâ€™t be instantiated directly and require subclasses to implement abstract methods.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. How can you prevent a child class from modifying certain attributes or methods inherited from a parent class in Python?\n",
    "You can use private attributes or methods (by prefixing with `_` or `__`) to restrict access. Python does not have true private access, but name mangling can help protect attributes from being modified.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._protected = \"protected\"\n",
    "        self.__private = \"private\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        # self.__private = \"new value\"  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Create a Python class called `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Then, create a child class `Manager` that inherits from `Employee` and adds an attribute `department`. Provide an example.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.salary = salary\n",
    "\n",
    "class Manager(Employee):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, salary, department):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, salary)\n",
    "        self.department = department\n",
    "\n",
    "manager = Manager(\"John Doe\", 75000, \"HR\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Discuss the concept of method overloading in Python inheritance. How does it differ from method overriding?\n",
    "Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense but allows default parameters and variable-length arguments. Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def display(self, *args):\n",
    "        for arg in args:\n",
    "            print(arg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Explain the purpose of the `__init__()` method in Python inheritance and how it is utilized in child classes.\n",
    "The `__init__()` method is the constructor method used to initialize a newly created object. In inheritance, the child class `__init__()` method can call the parent class `__init__()` method to ensure that the parent class is properly initialized.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. Create a Python class called `Bird` with a method `fly()`. Then, create child classes `Eagle` and `Sparrow` that inherit from `Bird` and implement the `fly()` method differently. Provide an example of using these classes.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Eagle(Bird):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Eagle soars high\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sparrow flutters\")\n",
    "\n",
    "eagle = Eagle()\n",
    "sparrow = Sparrow()\n",
    "eagle.fly()\n",
    "sparrow.fly()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18. What is the \"diamond problem\" in multiple inheritance, and how does Python address it?\n",
    "The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy. Python addresses this using the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures a consistent method resolution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19. Discuss the concept of \"is-a\" and \"has-a\" relationships in inheritance, and provide examples of each.\n",
    "\"is-a\" relationship means a class is a subclass of another class. \"has-a\" relationship means a class contains an instance of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is-a Relationship Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Has-a Relationship Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, engine):\n",
    "        self.engine = engine\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, engine):\n",
    "        self.engine = engine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20. Create a Python class hierarchy for a university system. Start with a base class `Person` and create child classes `Student` and `Professor`, each with their own attributes and methods. Provide an example of using these classes in a university context.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",

    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, age)\n",
    "        self.student_id = student_id\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_details(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Student Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, ID: {self.student_id}\"\n",
